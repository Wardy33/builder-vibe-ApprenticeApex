# ðŸ”§ App Recovery - Status Report

## Issue Resolved: 5xx Server Errors Fixed

### **Problem:**
The application was in a non-functional state with:
- Dev server showing as "running" but returning 5xx errors
- Proxy target http://localhost:5173/ not responding successfully
- Server-side errors preventing normal operation

### **Root Cause:**
The dev server process was in a problematic state - while marked as "running", it wasn't actually serving requests properly or had encountered internal errors.

### **Solution Applied:**
**Dev Server Restart:** Used `DevServerControl.restart()` to completely restart the development server process.
