- **Issue:** Risk of 503 errors after fixing 404
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Mock registration system for development mode
  - Better error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Graceful fallbacks when database is unavailable
- **Result:** No 503 errors observed, robust error handling in place

### 3. **Empty Job Cards Fix**
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue:** Job cards were loading but showing no content
- **Root Cause:** SwipeCard component had placeholder comment instead of actual content

- **Result:** Job cards now display full job information with images, titles, companies, descriptions
