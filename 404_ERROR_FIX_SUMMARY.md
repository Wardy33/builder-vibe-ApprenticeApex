# 404 Error Fix: `/CompanyAuth` Route Issue

**Issue**: User attempted to access non-existent route `/CompanyAuth`  
**Root Cause**: Component name being typed as URL instead of using proper routing  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 Problem Analysis

### Original Error

```
404 Error: User attempted to access non-existent route: /CompanyAuth
```

### Root Cause

- Someone attempted to access `/CompanyAuth` (component name as URL)
- The correct routes are `/company/signin` and `/company/signup`
- No route was defined for the raw component name path

### Impact

- Users receiving 404 errors when mistyping URLs
- Poor user experience for common routing mistakes
- No helpful suggestions for correct routes

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Redirect Routes (App.tsx)

Added redirect routes for common mistyped URLs:

```typescript
{/* Redirects for common mistyped URLs */}
<Route path="/CompanyAuth" element={<Navigate to="/company/signin" replace />} />
<Route path="/companyauth" element={<Navigate to="/company/signin" replace />} />
<Route path="/company-auth" element={<Navigate to="/company/signin" replace />} />
<Route path="/Company" element={<Navigate to="/company/signin" replace />} />
<Route path="/CandidateAuth" element={<Navigate to="/candidate/signin" replace />} />
<Route path="/StudentAuth" element={<Navigate to="/candidate/signin" replace />} />
<Route path="/CompanyPortal" element={<Navigate to="/company" replace />} />
<Route path="/CandidateApp" element={<Navigate to="/candidate" replace />} />
<Route path="/StudentApp" element={<Navigate to="/candidate" replace />} />
```

### 2. Enhanced 404 Page (NotFound.tsx)

- **Smart Route Suggestions**: Analyzes failed route and suggests correct alternatives
- **Context-Aware Help**: Shows relevant links based on the attempted route
- **Better UX**: More helpful error page with actionable solutions

### 3. Route Monitoring System (routeMonitoring.ts)

Created comprehensive monitoring system:

```typescript
// Features:
- Tracks all 404 errors with context
- Provides intelligent route suggestions
- Generates error reports for debugging
- Persists errors for analysis
- Available globally for debugging: window.routeMonitor
```

### 4. Pricing Page Route Verification

Confirmed the pricing page route is correctly implemented:

- Route: `/company/pricing` ✅
- Navigation: "Upgrade Plan" in company portal sidebar ✅
- Component: `CompanyPricingPage` ✅
